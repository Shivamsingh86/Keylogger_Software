# Keylogger_Software
A Python-based keylogger that captures all keystrokes and saves them to a timestamped log file. Designed for ethical cybersecurity learning, it runs in the background, works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and helps demonstrate how keyloggers work and how to detect them.

🎯 Project Objective:
To develop a basic keylogger that records user keystrokes, stores them securely, and demonstrates how such tools work — for cybersecurity training and awareness purposes.

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used:
Python – Programming language

pynput – For keyboard input monitoring

datetime – To timestamp logs

logging – To store logs securely

(Optional) tkinter – For basic GUI

(Optional) pyinstaller – To convert script into executable (.exe)

🧪 Features:
Logs all keystrokes typed by the user

Timestamps each keystroke

Saves logs in a hidden text file

Optionally sends logs to email (advanced)

Can run silently in the background

🔒 Legal & Ethical Note:
This project is strictly for educational use. Do not deploy on systems without permission. Unauthorized keylogging is illegal.

🔐 Keylogger Software in Cybersecurity

🧠 What is a Keylogger?
A keylogger (short for keystroke logger) is a type of surveillance software or hardware designed to record every keystroke made on a keyboard. It can be used for both legitimate monitoring and malicious purposes.

✅ Legitimate Uses in Cybersecurity
Keyloggers are not always malicious. In cybersecurity and IT environments, they may be used for:

Employee Monitoring: To track user activity in sensitive work environments.

Parental Control: To supervise children's online behavior.

User Behavior Analysis: To study typing habits in usability testing.

Security Audits: To trace potential insider threats by logging unauthorized keystrokes.

Penetration Testing (Ethical Hacking): Red teamers may deploy keyloggers to simulate how an attacker would steal credentials.

❌ Malicious Uses (Cybercrime)
However, in most cases, keyloggers are classified as spyware used for malicious intent, such as:

Stealing passwords, PINs, and banking credentials.

Capturing private communications (e.g., emails, chats).

Hijacking accounts and committing identity theft.

Gathering corporate secrets or sensitive data.

🧪 Types of Keyloggers
Software-based

Runs in the background and logs all keystrokes.

Examples: Kernel-based, API-based, Form Grabbing.

Hardware-based

Physical device plugged between keyboard and PC.

Undetectable by software antivirus.

🛡️ Cybersecurity Measures Against Keyloggers
Antivirus and Antimalware software: Detect and remove keyloggers.

Firewall Protection: Blocks keyloggers from sending data.

On-screen Keyboards: Useful for sensitive password entry.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Prevents account hijacking even if credentials are stolen.

Anti-Keylogger Tools: Specialized programs designed to detect and block keylogging behavior.

Behavioral Analysis Systems: Use AI/ML to detect suspicious patterns like stealthy data collection.

📌 Legal Status
Legal: When used for authorized monitoring with consent (e.g., within companies).

Illegal: Unauthorized installation or use for spying is a criminal offense in most countries.

📚 Conclusion
Keyloggers are a double-edged sword in cybersecurity. While useful in ethical hacking and monitoring, they are more often exploited by cybercriminals to compromise systems. Cybersecurity professionals must stay vigilant by deploying detection tools and promoting user awareness.

✅ How to Run:
Install dependencies:
pip install pynput

Run the keylogger:
python keylogger.py
Check the logs/ folder for output

⚠️ Disclaimer:
this software is for educational and authorized testing only. Do not deploy it on systems you do not own or without consent, as doing so violates privacy laws and cybersecurity ethics.
